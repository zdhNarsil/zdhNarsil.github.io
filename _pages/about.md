I am a senior undergradutate in School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University advised by [Prof. Zhanxing Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/zhanxingzhu/). I have also worked with [Prof. Qiang Liu](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lqiang/index.html).

This winter, I will apply for Ph.D.

**Research topics**
* Probablistic inference, bayesian methods and generative models.
* Adversarial robustness & certification.
* Optimization.
