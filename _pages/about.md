I am Dinghuai Zhang (张鼎怀), a PhD in Mila advised by [Prof. Aaron Courville](https://aaroncourville.wordpress.com/). I was an undergradutate in School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University, working with [Prof. Zhanxing Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/zhanxingzhu/) and [Prof. Bin Dong](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dongbin). I am always open to possible cooperation or visiting opportunities. If you are interested, please contact me by email or [wechat](https://zdhNarsil.github.io/images/wechatqrcode.jpeg).
 

**Research topics**
* Probablistic inference, bayesian methods & generative models.
* Adversarial robustness & certification.
* Causal inference & Out-of-distribution generalization.
* Representation learning & semi-supervised learning.
