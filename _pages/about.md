I am a last-year undergradutate in School of EECS at Peking University, majoring in Computer Science advised by [Prof. Zhanxing Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/zhanxingzhu/). I have been a research intern at [Megvii Inc.(Face++)](https://megvii.com)    mentored by [Dr. Xiangyu Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yuB-cfoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) since March, 2018. Currently visiting Berkeley!

This winter, I will apply for Ph.D.

**Research topics**
* Computer vision and deep learning, especially visual recognitions, maniuplating images.
* Efficient learning and inference. Speed up the training of NNs.  AutoML, NAS for light-weight NNs.
* Dynamic networks.
