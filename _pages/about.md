I am Dinghuai Zhang (张鼎怀), a senior undergradutate in School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University advised by [Prof. Zhanxing Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/zhanxingzhu/). I have also worked with [Prof. Qiang Liu](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lqiang/index.html) and [Prof. Bin Dong](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dongbin). I am always open to possible cooperation or visiting opportunities. If you are interested, please contact me by email or [wechat](https://zdhNarsil.github.io/images/wechatqrcode.jpeg).
 

**Research topics**
* Probablistic inference, bayesian methods & generative models.
* Adversarial robustness & certification.
* Causal inference.
* Unsupervised learning (representation learning) & semi-supervised learning.
