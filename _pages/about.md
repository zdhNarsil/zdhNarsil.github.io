I am Dinghuai Zhang (张鼎怀), a senior researcher at [Microsoft Research New England](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-england/) (*since lots of people asked... New England is in US, not in England!*). I have received my PhD training at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) in Prof. [Bengio](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kukA0LcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)'s group as well as [Aaron](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=km6CP8cAAAAJ&hl=en)'s Army (aka A.A.). During my PhD, I've interned at Apple [MLR](https://machinelearning.apple.com/) and [FAIR](https://ai.facebook.com/) labs.
Previously, I was an undergraduate in School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University, working with Prof. [Zhanxing Zhu](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=a2sHceIAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Bin Dong](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dongbin).

We are going to have [an interesting workshop](https://safegenaiworkshop.github.io/) on safety in [NeurIPS 2024 @ Vancouver](https://nips.cc/) this winter! 

~~Please consider contributing through [submitting](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICML.cc/2023/Workshop/SPIGM) and / or [reviewing](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdFJq3qPKNKAatfn4iYeuFftVtY5ji3HwwRzVBz31jJIclPTA/viewform)~~.

**Research interests**

I aim to tackle multidisciplinary problems with **generative models** and probabilistic methods.
* Multimodal modeling: tokenization, sequence modeling (autoregression & diffusion), etc
* Exploration with structure: RL, search, black-box optimization, active learning
* Scientific design & discovery as probabilistic inference

I've also conducted AI safety research (distribution shift, causal representation learning).

* I enjoy reading. I feel lucky to learn about wisdom from sociologists.
such as Georg Simmel, Norbert Elias, Max Weber, Sigmund Freud.
